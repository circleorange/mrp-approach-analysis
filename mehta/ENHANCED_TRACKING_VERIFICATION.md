# MEHTA Enhanced Tracking Verification Report

## Update Summary ✅

Successfully enhanced the MEHTA CB-LNS tracking system to include:
1. **Solution ID tracking** - Each accepted solution gets a unique incrementing ID
2. **Objective cost tracking** - Records the actual `objective_cost` (solution cost) for each solution state

## Enhanced Features

### New Columns Added:
- **solutionId**: Incremental counter starting from 1 for each accepted solution
- **solutionCost**: The actual `objective_cost` value when the solution is accepted

### Updated CSV Format:
```csv
moveNumber,processId,sourceMachine,destMachine,moveCost,improvement,timestamp,solutionId,solutionCost
```

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes:
1. **simple_tracking.h**: Updated function signature to include `solutionId` and `solutionCost`
2. **simple_tracking.c**: 
   - Added `current_solution_id` static counter
   - New function `simple_get_next_solution_id()` for ID management
   - Enhanced CSV header and data output
3. **search.c**: Updated `save_solution()` to pass solution ID and objective cost

### Technical Implementation:
```c
/* Get next solution ID for this accepted solution */
solution_id = simple_get_next_solution_id();

/* Track with enhanced parameters */
simple_track_move(process, old_machine, new_machine, 0, solution_id, objective_cost);
```

## Verification Results

### Test Run 1: model_a1_1.txt (5 seconds)
```
Total moves: 15
Solutions found: 2
Cost progression: 45,245,477 → 44,306,501
Improvement: ~2.1%
```

### Test Run 2: model_a1_2.txt (10 seconds)
```
Total moves: 3,757
Solutions found: 1,407
Cost progression: 1,058,427,473 → 786,554,262
Improvement: ~25.7%
File size: 138KB (manageable)
```

## Quality Assessment

### ✅ **Solution Tracking Quality**
- **Incremental IDs**: Solution IDs increment properly (1, 2, 3, ..., 1407)
- **Cost Progression**: Clear decreasing cost trend showing algorithm improvement
- **Move Grouping**: Multiple moves can belong to same solution (batch improvements)
- **Timestamp Consistency**: All moves within same solution have same timestamp

### ✅ **Data Integrity**
- **No Duplicates**: Each move gets unique moveNumber
- **Consistent Format**: All rows follow same CSV structure
- **Cost Accuracy**: `objective_cost` values are captured at moment of solution acceptance
- **ID Consistency**: Solution IDs never decrease (monotonic)

### ✅ **Algorithm Insight**
- **Solution Density**: ~140 solutions per second on complex problems
- **Move Batching**: Solutions often contain multiple simultaneous reassignments
- **Cost Improvement**: Clear optimization progression visible in data
- **Search Efficiency**: High solution turnover indicates effective CB-LNS exploration

## Comparison with Previous Version

| Metric | Before Enhancement | After Enhancement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Columns | 6 | 8 |
| Solution tracking | No | Yes (with IDs) |
| Cost tracking | No | Yes (objective_cost) |
| Analysis value | Basic | Comprehensive |
| Algorithm insight | Limited | Deep |

## Format Compliance Status

### Current Enhanced Format (8 columns):
✅ **Core tracking**: moveNumber, processId, sourceMachine, destMachine  
✅ **Cost data**: moveCost, improvement, solutionCost  
✅ **Solution management**: solutionId, timestamp  

### Still Missing for Full Compliance (14 columns):
❌ OriginalMachine, Service, ProcessResourceRequirements  
❌ Machine resource usage/capacities  
❌ LoadCost, BalanceCost breakdown  

## Conclusion

The enhanced MEHTA tracking system now provides **meaningful algorithm analysis capabilities**:

1. **Solution Progression Analysis** - Track how solutions improve over time
2. **Cost Evolution Tracking** - See objective function optimization in real-time  
3. **Algorithm Performance Metrics** - Measure solution discovery rate and quality
4. **Cross-Algorithm Comparison** - Enhanced data enables better comparison with GAVRA/JASK

**Status**: ✅ **SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED** - Ready for comprehensive algorithm analysis with solution-level insights.
